# Chat Commands

Chat commands (also called [slash commands](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/slash-commands.html)) are the primary way users interact with an application on Discord. There are several types of options a command can be - a `String`, `Integer`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `User`, `Channel`, `Role`, or `Mentionable`. Each type helps by providing basic input validation.

See [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/slash-commands/advanced-creation.html#adding-options) for addtional help with options.

Additionally, you may want to group commands together. This is done with `Subcommands` and `Subcommand Groups`. See [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/slash-commands/advanced-creation.html#subcommands) for addtional help with subcommands.

## Create a Chat Command Object

1. Create a new file corresponding to the command you want to create. We typically define the following:

- `builder` - A discord.js [`SlashCommandBuilder`](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.18.0/SlashCommandBuilder:Class).
  - `name` - The name of the command
  - `description` - A description of what the command does
  - Localization configuration
- `execute` - The function that will run on the command invocation
- *Optional* `guildIds` - An array of server IDs. *Only use if the command will be exclusive to a set of servers*.
- *Optional* `autoComplete` - function to run on uses of option [autocomplete](https://discordjs.guide/slash-commands/autocomplete.html)

```ts
// src/commands/chat/ping.ts
import { ChatInputCommand } from '../../Classes/index.js';

export default new ChatInputCommand()
  .setBuilder((builder) => builder
    .setName('ping')
    .setDescription('The bot will reply with pong'))
  .setExecute(async (interaction) => {
    interaction.reply('🏓 Pong');
  });
```

2. Export the defined command in [`index.ts`](../index.ts).

```ts
// src/commands/index.ts
export { default as ping } from './chat/ping.js';
```

3. Register the commands with the client in the root [`index.ts`](../../index.ts).

```ts
// src/index.ts
import { Client } from './Classes/index.js';
import * as commands from './commands/index.js';

const client = new Client();

// Load commands 
for (const command of Object.values(commands)) client.commands.add(command);
```
