# Modals

[Modal](https://discordjs.guide/interactions/modals.html) interactions create a pop up window in the Discord client for form-like text entry.

## Creating an Interaction

Interactions start with the bot [sending the modal](https://discordjs.guide/interactions/modals.html#building-and-responding-with-modals). To receive this interaction upon it being used, follow the below steps:

1. Create an interaction object:

- `customIdPrefix` - Is used to identify which interactions should be triggered
- `run` - The function which is called on the occurrence of the interaction

```ts
// src/interactions/modals/modal.ts
import { ModalSubmitInteraction } from "discord.js";
import { Interaction } from "../../../Classes/index.js";

export default new Interaction<ModalSubmitInteraction>({
  customIdPrefix: "modal",
  run: async (interaction) => {
    /* Some Code */
  },
});
```

2. Export `default` the object you just made as a unique name in [`index.ts`](index.ts)

```ts
// src/interactions/modals/index.ts
export { default as string } from "./modal.js";
```

3. In the root [`index.ts`](../../index.ts), make sure the following is present:

```ts
// src/index.ts
import { Client } from "./Classes/index.js";
import * as modals from "./interactions/modals/index.js";

export const client = new Client({
  receiveMessageComponents: true, // enables the usage of message components
  splitCustomIDOn: "_", // allows the inclusion of additional information in a custom ID
  // `prefix_arg1_arg2` is converted to [prefix, arg1, arg2]
});

// Load modals
for (const modal of Object.values(modals)) client.interactions.addModal(modal);
```
