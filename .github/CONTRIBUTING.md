# Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Issues

Scan through our [existing issues](https://trello.com/b/70if94AU/crm) to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix, as along as nobody else is assigned to that issue.

## Make Changes

### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository. You should generally do this instead of making branches in the repository itself.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes! *Make sure this is not the same branch as the `main` branch.*

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Make sure to run the test commands to see if they catch anything unusual. Please make sure to add changes in those files if you have relevant changes as well.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link to the relevant Trello issue if you are solving one.
Once you submit your PR, tests should run automatically to make sure the code passes basic tests.
