## **REVIEW THE FOLLOWING AND DELETE AFTER READING**

Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

    a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

    b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

    c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

    d. `yarn test` doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

    a. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

    b. Provide a description of your changes.

    c. If applicable, indicate what issue your pull request closes. For example, add anywhere in the description the following: `closes #10`. This is done so the relevant issue is automatically closed when this is merged.

IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.
